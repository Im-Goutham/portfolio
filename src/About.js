          <p>I'm Goutham, a broken heart ðŸ’” Developer. I do a lot of different things but majority of the time I'm a full stack developer.</p>
          <p>I completed my education in year 2016 and soon after it started my career as a software developer.</p>
          <p>At my current company I have been into some projects. You can view most of the finished pieces of work on the <NavLink to="/work">Work page</NavLink>.</p>
          <p>Apart from that Iâ€™m most likely listening songs, watching some code stuff on YouTube, roaming around on by bike, or watching the cricket.</p>
          <p>Iâ€™m nearly always available for something, so if you ever feel like Iâ€™m the man for the job, then check out the <NavLink to="/contact">Contact page</NavLink> where you can find the best place to do so!</p>
